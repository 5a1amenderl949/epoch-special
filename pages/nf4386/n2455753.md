  【大纪元3月9日讯】第24届世界大学生冬季运动会（大冬会）于2009年2月18日至28日在中国黑龙江省哈尔滨市举行。根据从中国大陆传出的消息，黑龙江省的一些城市在此期间以该大冬会的名义大肆抓捕法轮功学员。
 </p>
 <p>
  大冬会安保工作是“比照奥运标准”部署。而北京奥运安保被中共利用来迫害法轮功。2008年10月至12月，在中共黑龙江省委政法委的指挥下，该省进行了持续三个月的严打“秋风行动”。黑龙江省公安厅有关负责人声称“一定要打好这一仗。不仅要管一时，还要管长远，要打得本地犯罪份子至少三年不敢妄动，外来犯罪分子不敢来黑龙江作案。”从12月开始，“秋风行动”扩大到东北和内蒙古四省区的“打流窜、抓逃犯、保大冬”统一行动。2009年1月，公安部副部长刘京（中共中央610办公室主任）到黑龙江省主持召开东北及内蒙古、新疆五省区公安机关协作会议，将“大冬会”安保工作辐射到了黑龙江省周边省区。此外，黑龙江警方还就大冬会安保和俄罗斯远东地区内务局进行跨国合作。2009年2月，中共中央政法委书记周永康在东北地区考察六天后，于2月17日，即大冬会开幕的前一天，参加了在沈阳召开的东北地区政法暨维护稳定工作座谈会并讲话。
 </p>
 <p>
  在大冬会主赛场之一的哈尔滨市，南岗区区长丁坚在全区服务“大冬会”工作领导小组第一次会议上的讲话中，强调要加大对“法轮功”的打击力度。黑龙江省五大连池（属黑河市）公安局提出的大冬会安保确立实现的“十不发生”目标中，两项是针对法轮功的。在大冬会火炬传递的六个城市之一的七台河市，严密监控法轮功学员的任务一直落实到了街镇。在齐齐哈尔市，大冬会稳控的“五类重点人”中法轮功学员列在首位（另外四类是：银行买断人员、退役军人、下岗职工和棚改居民）黑龙江省北安市（属黑河市）“做好哈尔滨大冬会期间信访稳定安全保卫工作实施方案”中提出对法轮功“坚持主动出击、露头就打的原则”。哈尔滨海关还加强了对“法轮功类出版物”的封堵查验。
 </p>
 <p>
  大冬会火炬经过的六个城市之一的佳木斯市，2008年12月1日至4日，省大冬会安保维稳工作督导组到佳木斯，对安保维稳工作进行检查指导。大冬会前夕和期间，佳木斯市发生了大规模任意抓捕法轮功学员的事件。据法轮大法明慧网披露，被非法绑架的有傅玉、沈国、王贵珍（音）、黄卫中、栾秀媛、刘孝斌、陈万友、孙庆河、李秀荣、张淑英、周富荣（音）、赵有、田海涛、张培清、张桂芝、宋玉芝、单玉琴、于晓玲等。（注）这些学员都遭到不同程度迫害，有的还受到酷刑毒打。

   主要责任部门和责任人
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  周永康（中共中央政法委书记）、刘京（公安部副部长、中央610办公室主任）、黄建盛（中共黑龙江省委常委、省委政法委书记）、孙永波（副省长，省公安厅党委书记、公安厅长）、郭严（省督导组组长、省委政法委副书记）、滕晓光（省督导组组长、省委政法委副秘书长）、蒋志芳（佳木斯市副市长、市公安局党委书记兼局长、佳木斯市大冬会安全保卫工作领导小组组长）、屈振远（中共佳木斯市政法委书记）、刘衍（佳木斯市政法委副书记、市610办公室主任）。
 </p>
 <p>
  中共长期以来，把在中国举办的国际商业、文化、体育活动变成了迫害人权、特别是迫害法轮功的借口。

   追查国际
  </ok>
  提醒国际社会注意这一现象，在参加这些活动的同时不要忘记由于这些活动而遭受迫害的人们。追查国际也正告在这些活动中参与迫害法轮功的个人，你们的一举一动都被记录在案，最终会成为你们因为侵犯人权而受审的证据。追查国际要求不是主动参与迫害法轮功的个人，从现在起立即停止作恶，收集并保存你的上司、同事、下级的犯罪证据，争取得到受害者原谅和宽恕。
 </p>
 <p>
  注：被绑架的法轮功学员中，目前获释回家的有：张培清、张桂芝、宋玉芝、单玉琴、于晓玲等。

   Investigation on CCP Persecuting Falun Gong Practitioners in the Name of the Winter Universiade – Jiamusi City
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  March 1, 2009
 </p>
 <p>
  The 24th Winter Word University Games (The 24th Winter Universiade, or the “Game” in short below) took place from February 18 to 28, 2009 in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province. [1] Based on information channeled out of China, under the guise of the “Game”, a large number of Falun Gong practitioners were arrested in some cities of Heilongjiang Province.
 </p>
 <p>
  The security arrangement for the “Game” was on a par with the “Olympics Standard”. [2] And the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exploited the Beijing Olympics security arrangement to persecute Falun Gong. [3] Between October and December of 2008, under the command of the Political and Judicial Committee of the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, a three-month-long “Strike Hard” campaign called “Operation Autumn Wind” was carried out in the province. The official in charge at the Heilongjiang Public Security Bureau claimed that “We must win this battle. It’s not our short term, but long term goal. We must strike so hard that local criminals dare not to make any trouble for at least 3 years, and out of province criminals dare not to come to Heilongjiang to cause trouble.” [4] From December 2008 onwards, “Operation Autumn Wind” was expanded into two other Northeastern provinces and Inner Mongolia area, and merged with the consolidated operation of “Striking the fleer, Seizing the escapee, and Safeguarding the Winter Universiade”. [5]
 </p>
 <p>
  In January 2009, vice-minister of Public Security Liu Jing (also the director of the CCP Central “610 Office”) came to Heilongjiang Province to conduct the Northeast China, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang “Five Province Public Security Organizations Coordination Conference”, thus bringing the security arrangement of the Winter Universiade to the provinces surrounding Heilongjiang. [6] Furthermore, to safeguard the “Game”, Heilongjiang police even worked with the Russian Far East Bureau of Internal Affairs for international cooperation. [7] After six days of review and inspection, on February 17, 2009, one day before the opening of the “Game”, secretary of the Political and Judicial Committee of the CCP Central Committee Zhou Yongkang participated the “Northeastern Region Political and Judicial and Safeguarding Stability Work Conference” held in Shenyang and spoke at the conference. [8]
 </p>
 <p>
  In Harbin City, one of the major competition sites of the “Game”, Nangang District head Ding Jian emphasized to strike “Falun Gong” harder, in his speech at the first meeting of the event leadership team. [9] Regarding the event safety, the Police Department of Wudalianchi (belongs to Heihe City) in Heilongjiang listed “10 preventions” goal, of which two targeted at Falun Gong. [10] In Qitaihe, one of the six cities that the “Game” torch passed through, Falun Gong practitioners were strictly monitored even in towns and streets. [11] In Qiqihaer, among “five major targets” of the event security concern, Falun Gong practitioners were listed at the top. (The other four types of people were: bank buyout personnel, veteran, lay-off worker, and forced-moving resident) [12] In the “Security Work Plan of Appealing Safety during Harbin Winter Universiade” of Bei’an (belongs to Heihe City), Heilongjiang, “sticking to the principle of initiating attack and striking at first appearance” was stated in dealing with Falun Gong issue. [13] Harbin custom also enhanced checking and blocking of “Falun Gong related publications”. [14]
 </p>
 <p>
  In Jiamusi City, one of the six cities that the “Game” torch passed through, from December 1 to 4, 2008, provincial event security supervising group arrived there for inspection. [15] Just before and during the “Game”, large scale arbitrary arrest of Falun Gong practitioners took place in that city. According to Falun Dafa’s website minghui.ca, many practitioners were kidnapped including Fu Yu, Shen Guo, Wang Guizhen, Huang Weizhong, Luan Xiuyuan, Liu Xiaobin, Sun
  <br/>
  Qinghe, Li Xiurong, Zhang Shuying, Zhou Furong, Zhao You, Tian Haitao, Zhang Peiqing, Zhang Guizhi, Song Yuzhi, Shan Yuqin, Yu Xiaoling, an so on. All of them were subject to persecution of various extent, some were tortured and some were beaten violently. [16]
 </p>
 <p>
  Major responsible persons include:
 </p>
 <p>
  Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the Political and Judiciary Committee of the CCP Central Committee
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Jing, vice-minister of Public Security, director of Central “610 Office”
 </p>
 <p>
  Huang Jiansheng, standing committee member of the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, secretary of the Political and Judiciary Committee of the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee
 </p>
 <p>
  Sun Yongbo, vice-governor, secretary of the provincial Public Security Bureau’s CCP Committee, director of police department
 </p>
 <p>
  Guo Yan, provincial supervising group leader, deputy secretary of the Political and Judiciary Committee of the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee
 </p>
 <p>
  Teng Xiaoguang, provincial supervising group leader, deputy secretary-general of the Political and Judiciary Committee of the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee
 </p>
 <p>
  Jiang Zhifang, vice mayor of Jiamusi City, secretary of municipal police department CCP committee and director of police department, Winter Universiade security leadership group head of Jiamusi
 </p>
 <p>
  Qu Zhenyuan, secretary of the Political and Judiciary Committee of the CCP Jiamusi Committee
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Yan, deputy secretary of the Political and Judiciary Committee of the CCP Jiamusi Committee, director of city “610 Office”.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a long time, the CCP has exploited those international business, culture and sports events held in China into human rights violation opportunities, especially toward Falun Gong. The Wo7=rld Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong (WOIPFG) raises this issue with the international community, and reminds people attending the events not to forget those who suffer persecution because of those events. WOIPFG also warns those involved in persecuting Falun Gong during those events, that every act of you has been recorded, and may eventually become evidence of your human rights violation crime. WOIPFG advises those participating in persecuting Falun Gong passively stop evildoing immediately from now on, collect and keep crime evidence of your supervisor, co-worker and subordinate, so as to ask for pardon and forgiveness from the victims.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note: At present, the following abducted Falun Gong practitioners have been released and gone home: Zhang Peiqing, Zhang Guizhi, Song Yuzhi, Shan Yuqin, Yu Xiaoling, and so on.
